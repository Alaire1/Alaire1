ðŸŽ“ I'm a dedicated student at 42 coding school. Currently, I'm focused on learning the fundamentals of C programming language, which serves as a solid foundation for many other languages.

ðŸ’» Besides C, I also have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These web technologies allow me to create dynamic and interactive websites, where I can bring my creative ideas to life.

ðŸŽ¨ Art holds a special place in my heart. I enjoy expressing my creativity through drawing, both on paper and digitally.

ðŸŽ® Gaming is another passion of mine, especially RPGs (role-playing games). I love immersing myself in vast virtual worlds, embarking on epic quests, and unraveling captivating storylines.

ðŸ”¬ Additionally, I have a deep fascination with science. I constantly seek to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest scientific discoveries.

ðŸŒŸ I'm excited to be part of the GitHub community, where I can collaborate with fellow developers, share my projects, and contribute to open-source initiatives. If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out. Let's learn and grow together on this coding journey!
